# Assignment1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

## Git

During the development of the project, all my files are stored in a git repository called 3813Assignment. This repository is just created for storing my project and version control. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. So I used git for the version control of the project, if the application is crashed due to various reasons, I can revert it back to the previous version then I still have my project. And if your project files are lost, you can still get the files back by using git. The features that I have used during my project development are just storing the files to the repository by using git command "git add", "git commit" and "git push". "git add" command to add the files to the stage, "git commit" to commit the change, and "git push" to push the files to the remote repository which is the repository on Git Hub. I didn't use features like revert or something like that because the devevelopment progress was quite successful, no crashes occured. 

## Angular Architecture

The 
## REST API

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Data Structure

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Stage Change

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
